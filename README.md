This project was made to fill in knowledge gaps, as I had previously only worked with Java in Spring Framework. Because of that, I built this without spring so that I could understand what exactly spring adds to a project compared to standard Java. 
Other than that, this is a javaFX inventory management system that I built for my own curiosity and practice.
